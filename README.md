## Description

__What is it?__\
Nocoli (Notes Code Links) is a GoogleDoc-like note-taking tool primarily for documenting code snippets for future reference. It has a markdown parser to format these snippets for greater readability. It also has a tagging functionality to allow fast searching and improved organization of notes.


__Who is it for?__\
It is for note-takers.

__Why build it?__\
As a note-taker myself, I find that links and code snippets make my notes look messy and disorganized. Hence, I built Nocoli to format and organize my notes as I take them down.

__How is it built?__\
_Tech Stack_:
Postgres, React (Material UI), Express.js, Node.js


## Demo Instructions

1) Click on existing notes to edit them or add new notes.
2) Try writing some markdown using the markdown guide.
3) Close the editor mode and notes will be automatically saved.
